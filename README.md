# ChapterRandomizer
Simple video shuffler, made for a very specific purpose for a cartoon show about a very particular yellow tinted family, but of course it'll work for any TV show that you want to shuffle.

## Prerequisites
You'll need to have [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) installed beforehand. The app will warn about this if it's not installed or can't detect it.


## Usage
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/ahdistefano/ChapterRandomizer/releases). Upon opening the executable file, it'll ask you to select the folder where the episodes are located in, and if you want to enable the "nostalgia" mode. Note that this'll make sense for argentinian folks only, otherwise ignore it :)

You can also run it through command line avoiding GUI. Here's an example:

    ChapterRandomizer.exe -p "C:\Path\To\YourFolder" -n "N"

Here are the parameters it allows:

> **-p**	: Path to the folder where the episodes are located in.
>
> **-n**	: Enable (*"Y"*) or disable (*"N"*) nostalgia.

## Videos
You might be wondering where are the episodes of the so famous yellow family (in espaÃ±ol latino, por supuesto). Unfortunately I can't share this due to legal reasons. *But*, I'll leave this here and it's up to you what to do with it:
